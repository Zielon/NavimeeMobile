# Contributing

We welcome contributions to help keep the boilerplate up-to-date with the latest versions and best practices.

Simply fork the repository to make your changes, then open a pull request with a little comment about what you are proposing to change and why.
Be sure to stick to our [code style guidelines](https://github.com/ribot/android-guidelines) and make sure the tests pass.

Please note: this is a boilerplate project from which we intend to make it as easy as possible to start new projects. As such, we'd like to keep the features to a minimum and steer away from merging "showcase features".
